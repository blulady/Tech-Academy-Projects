Asynchronous: without time, doesn't have to be complete before the next steps ie:an asynchronous element would be if no matching documents are found after searching for a particular student the program could send an email to that student & mv on with checking the next student w/o waiting for the entire email process to occur
vs
sychronous process: each separate steps of the process are done consecutively
