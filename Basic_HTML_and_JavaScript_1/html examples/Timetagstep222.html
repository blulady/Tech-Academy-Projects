	<h1> The Time Element </h1>
	<p> How to define a time and date. The time tag defines a specific time (or datetime).
		The datetime attribute of this element is used to translate the time into a 
		machine-readable format so that browsers can offer to add date reminders 
		through the user's calendar, and search engines can produce smarter search results.
	</p>
	<p>Open from <time>10:00</time> to <time>11:00</time> every weekday.</p>
	<p>I have a date on <time datetime="2020-2-14 20:00">Valentines day</time>.</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> The time element does not render as anything special in any of the major browsers.</p>
