		<h1> Robert Frost's<br> 
		The Road Less Traveled<h1>
		<p> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
			And sorry I could not ravel both<br>
			And be on traveler, long I stood<br>
			And looked down one as far as I could<br>
			To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br><br>
			Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
			And having perhaps the better claim, <br>
			Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
			Though as for that the passing there <br> 
			Had worn them really abou the same, <br><br>
			And both that morning equally lay <br>
			In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
			Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
			Yet know how way leads on to way, <br>
			I doubted if I should ever come back<br><br>
			I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
			Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
			Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br>
			Took the one less traveld by,<br>
			And that has made all the difference.
