        Capitalism in its modern form can be traced to the emergence of agrarian capitalism
        and mercantilism in the early Renaissance, in city-states like Florence.[36] Capital
        has existed incipiently on a small scale for centuries[37] in the form of merchant, 
        renting and lending activities and occasionally as small-scale industry with some 
        wage labour. Simple commodity exchange and consequently simple commodity production, 
        which is the initial basis for the growth of capital from trade, have a very long 
        history. Arabs promulgated capitalist economic policies such as free trade and 
        banking. Their use of Indo-Arabic numerals facilitated bookkeeping. These innovations
        migrated to Europe through trade partners in cities such as Venice and Pisa. 
        The Italian mathematician Fibonacci traveled the Mediterranean talking to Arab
        traders and returned to popularize the use of Indo-Arabic numerals in Europe.[38]
