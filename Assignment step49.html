			<h4> Climbing is awesome.</h4>
			<main>
				<p> Climbing is a lot of fun. You get to be out in the middle of nowwhere with 
			only the people that you bring. It is quiet and calm. At night you can see the skies. 
			During the day you get to go hunting for treasure. Carrying packs and walking long distances,
			Breathing fresh air. </P
